### Installation

#### Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/zju3dv/street_crafter.git --recursive
```

#### Set up the environment

Our model is tested on one A100/A800 80GB GPU.

```
conda create -n streetcrafter python=3.9
conda activate streetcrafter

# Install dependencies.
pip install torch==2.4.0 torchvision==0.19.0 torchaudio==2.4.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

```


### Data Processing
Please go to `data_processor` and refer to [README.md](data_processor/README.md) for processing details.
We provide some example scenes on this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a9RirdkWONZ6DUNXEo_wUk-yefM5ryEd?usp=drive_link). You can skip the processing steps and download the data to `data/waymo` directory.


### Model Weights
The pretrained model weights can be downloaded from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qtdkm0wvIUSMWQMVldd-d16rHZsNFFt1/view?usp=drive_link) to `video_diffusion/ckpts` directory. We also provide the model weights trained using multi-cameras of Waymo under this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GUZw4s2-B9KmUWYNduHa-ur5kVciOyTI/view?usp=drive_link).


### Inference

Inference video diffusion model
```
python render.py --config {config_path} mode diffusion
```

We also provide another option for inference by setting the meta info file path.
```
# run the command under video diffusion directory
python sample_condition.py  
```

### Distillation

We distill the video diffusion model into dynamic 3D representation based on the codebase of [Street Gaussians](https://zju3dv.github.io/street_gaussians/). Please refer to `street_gaussian/config/config.py` for details of parameters.

Train street gaussian
```
python train.py --config {config_path} 
```

Render input trajectory
```
python render.py --config {config_path} mode trajectory
```

Render novel trajectory
```
python render.py --config {config_path} mode novel_view
```


### Training 
First download the model weights of Vista from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bCM7XLDquRqnnpauQAK5j1jP-n0y1ama/view) to `video_diffusion/ckpts` directory. 
We finetune the video diffuson model based on the codebase of [Vista](https://opendrivelab.com/Vista/). Please refer to their official [Documents](video_diffusion/docs/) for environment setup and training details.
```
# run the command under video diffusion directory
sh training.sh
```



### Overview
![pipeline](assets/pipeline.png)
(a) We process the LiDAR using calibrated images and object tracklets to obtain a colorized point cloud, which can be rendered to image space as pixel-level conditions. 
(b) Given observed images and reference image embedding $\mathbf{c}_\text{ref}$, we optimize the video diffusion model conditioned on the LiDAR renderings to perform controllable video generation. 
(c) Starting from the rendered images and LiDAR conditions under novel trajectory, we use the pretrained controllable video diffusion model to guide the optimization of the dynamic 3DGS representation by generating novel views as extra supervision signals.
